# Competition 1 (loops)

1. Create a program that draws five random numbers, from 1 to 10. Ensure that the same number isnâ€™t drawn twice.

2. Create a program that simulates the roll of a die. Have the program output the rolls of six dice repeatedly until at least four of the dice roll the same number.

3. Write a program with a function that converts a string of digits into an integer value. Do not use the strtol() function or any other standard C library function. Write your own!

4. By using two-dimensional array, write C program to display a matrix as shown below: 
<pre>
0	1	1	1	1 
-1	0	1	1	1
-1	-1	0	1	1
-1	-1	-1	0	1
-1	-1	-1	-1	0
</pre>

5. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. 
What if you cannot use any advanced data structures, only arrays?

6. Design an algorithm to find all pairs of integers within an array which sum to a specified value.

7. Design an algorithm to figure out if someone has won a game of tic-tac-toe.
