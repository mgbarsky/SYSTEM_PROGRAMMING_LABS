# Reverse name
### Exercise 16
Write a function named <tt>reverse_name</tt> that takes two parameters:
- <tt>src</tt>: a string of the form "firstname lastname"
- <tt>dest</tt>: an uninitialized char array; guaranteed to have the same size as <tt>src</tt>

<tt>reverse_name</tt> should set <tt>dest</tt> to have the same content as <tt>src</tt>, but in the format "lastname firstname".

For example, if <tt>src</tt> were "John Smith", <tt>dest</tt> should be "Smith John" after the function runs.
