# Update contact
### Exercise 18

In file include/contact.h the new type struct <em>contact</em> is defined.

In file test/contact_test.c a variable friend of type contact is declared and initialized.

Your task is to write in file contact.c the function <tt>update_contact</tt> which takes a pointer to the struct contact, a new name, a new number, and a new address to change the structâ€™s members. Look at the function declaration for the order of arguments and appropriate types.
