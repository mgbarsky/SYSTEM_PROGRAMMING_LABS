# Fibonacci sequence
### Exercise 14

Implement a function <tt>void fib(...)</tt> in file src/fib.c. This function generates the first <em>n</em> values in the Fibonacci sequence (<em>n</em> is a parameter). Recall that this sequence is defined by the following recursive formula: <tt>fib[n] = fib[n-2] + fib[n-1]</tt>. The first 6 elements of the sequence are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5.

The values should be stored in a dynamically allocated array composed of exactly the correct number of integers. The values should be returned through a pointer parameter passed in as the first argument.
