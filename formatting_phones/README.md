# Formatting phones
### Exercise 2
Some people write phone numbers like this 416-967-1111 and other people write them like this 905.736.3636.

For this problem, in file src/phones.c you will write a function <code>format_phone</code> that takes phone number formatting with dots (the latter version), and changes it to have dashes (the former version).

The parameter phone_num is a 12 element array of characters with dots, after the area code and after the next 3 digits. Change those dots to dashes.
