### Exercise 9

In file src/sum_card.c implement the body of the function <code>sum_card(int **score_card, int size)</code> which returns the sum of the values at the address(es) pointed to by elements of the <code>score_card</code> array. <code>score_card</code> has <code>size</code> elements, each of which is a pointer to int.
