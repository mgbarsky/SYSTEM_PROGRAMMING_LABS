# String - array vs. literal
### Exercise 12

In file src/experiment.c define a string called <tt>greetings</tt> that has space for 15 characters (including the null terminator) and set its initial value to "salutations". Then define a string literal with the name <tt>farewell</tt> that has the value "goodbye".

Based on the variables you declared above, choose and leave the expressions that are legal. Delete illegal expressions.
* greetings[12] = '!';   
* farewell[4] = '-';   
* farewell = "bye";   
* greetings[16] = '\0';   
* greetings[14] = '\0';
